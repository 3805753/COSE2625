We have a solid understanding of our environmental needs. Our focus is strongly based on a shared commitment to delivering strategic outcomes and we confidently deliver considered and sustainable solutions to client projects and offer a collaborative approach to managing all environmental matters and any risk. We deliver advice and products on time, within budget and at the highest quality.
                    
                    Environmental Projects specialises in regulatory and compliance aspects for environmental management, environmental monitoring, due diligence and risk management, impact assessment, environmental approvals, site contamination assessment, management and remediation, environmental management systems, and stakeholder engagement.
                    
                    Our team of professional scientists, engineers and managers has delivered many projects of varying sizes, from less than $1000 up to several million dollars in value, and of varying technical complexities involving one or more expert areas. We predominantly work in South Australia but work interstate from time to time; we are familiar with Australian legislation and legislation across several State jurisdictions across Australia.
